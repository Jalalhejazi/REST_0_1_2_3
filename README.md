Richardson Maturity Model, a concept by Leonard Richardson that describes the maturity level of a RESTful web service. The model outlines four levels of REST services, starting from Level 0, which is the use of HTTP as a transport system for remote interactions, to Level 3, which involves the use of hypermedia controls.

Here's a brief summary of each level:





| Level | Name                | Description                                                                                     |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0     | SOAP       | HTTP is used merely as a transport system for remote interactions.                              |
| 1     | Resources           | Introduces the concept of resources, where individual endpoints represent different entities.    |
| 2     | HTTP Verbs          | Makes use of HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources.|
| 3     | Hypermedia Controls | Uses hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), allowing dynamic client navigation.|


The Richardson Maturity Model is often used to gauge how "RESTful" a web service is, and it provides a roadmap for improving the design of such services.
