Richardson Maturity Model, a concept by Leonard Richardson that describes the maturity level of a RESTful web service. The model outlines four levels of REST services, starting from Level 0, which is the use of HTTP as a transport system for remote interactions, to Level 3, which involves the use of hypermedia controls.

Here's a brief summary of each level:

- Level 0: The "Swamp of POX" - At this level, HTTP is used merely as a transport system for remote interactions. SOAP and XML-RPC often fall into this category.

- Level 1: Resources - The next level introduces the concept of resources, where individual endpoints represent different entities in the system.

- Level 2: HTTP Verbs - This level makes use of HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform CRUD operations on resources.

- Level 3: Hypermedia Controls - The most mature level of REST involves the use of hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS), allowing the client to navigate through the application dynamically.

The Richardson Maturity Model is often used to gauge how "RESTful" a web service is, and it provides a roadmap for improving the design of such services.
